# Hello-World-
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
Bear in mind that a real-life project goes through a three-dimensional method in some form or other. 
First, it's important to think and talk about the problem in need of solving without jumping onto a laptop. 
Once that is done, bear in mind that the foundation of machine learning and deep learning relies on mathematics. 
Finally, once the problem has been discussed and mathematically represented, it is time to develop the solution.
